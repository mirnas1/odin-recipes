            <li>Mix all of your powders/sugars into your tea well until the powder gets fully disolved 
                into the tea and takes on a light brown color</li>
            <li>Fill the rest of your shaker cup with ice and shake shake shake!! (make sure the tea becomes cold, 
                if it hasn't you might need to throw some more ice into your cup or find a bigger shaker cup and put more ice)</li>
            <li>Take your drinking cup/glass and pour a generous amount of brown sugar in, dazzling the inside and 
                rim of your glass to perfection </li>
            <p>Voala!! Your brown sugar Milk tea is finished. If you would like to add any boba or tapioca you can do so! However
